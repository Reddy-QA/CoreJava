The Process by Implementing the super class method into the sub class is called as the Method overriding
First we have to create the Interface class and then by using the Implemets keyword we can access the Interface class.

package Interface;

public interface DemoInterface {
	
	public  void m1();
	
	public void m2();
	
}

package Interface;

public class DemoInterfaceMain implements DemoInterface {

	@Override
	public void m1() {
		System.out.println("Abstract class m1 method");
		
	}

	public void m2() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("Abstract class m2 method");
	}

}
